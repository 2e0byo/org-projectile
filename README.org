org-projectile provides functions for the creation of [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] TODOs that are associated with [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][projectile]] projects.

* Installation

Install from MELPA with package-install org-projectile. See the [[https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa][melpa repository]] for details about how to set up MELPA if you have not already done so.

* Usage
Before using org-projectile, you must specify the file you would like to use for storing project TODOs, as well a keybinding for taking a project note with org-capture and a global keybinding for ~org-projectile:project-todo-completing-read~.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'org-projectile)
(setq org-projectile:projects-file "/your/path/to/an/org/file/for/storing/projects.org")
(add-to-list 'org-capture-templates (org-projectile:project-todo-entry "p"))
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c n p") 'org-projectile:project-todo-completing-read)
#+END_SRC

Alternatively, using jwiegley's excellent [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package org-projectile
  :bind (("C-c n p" . org-projectile:project-todo-completing-read))
  :config
  (progn
    (setq org-projectile:projects-file "/your/path/to/an/org/file/for/storing/projects.org")
    (add-to-list 'org-capture-templates (org-projectile:project-todo-entry "p")))
  :ensure t)
#+END_SRC
